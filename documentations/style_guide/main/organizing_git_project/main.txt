    16. Release versioning and development versioning are seperate concepts, do not attempt to use Release versioning while adding updates to the back-end segment of the projects.

    17. remote branches must always have their name set as part of the API they are going to effect,
        - e.x: I'm currently working on documentations, so I name my branch: ( documentations ),
        - note that this is not the same as the scope of the commit message.

    18. Local branches MUST have the same name as their purpose, e.x: fix(docs): add local branch name rule.

    19. Always create a new remote branch and pull request before merging, after you have made all the changes required in the to_do.

    20. Contributors MUST Always create a pull request and branch before even attempting to add any changes to their local repository.

    21. Pull request titles MUST refer to the feat or MAJOR change commit message which is expected to be the outcome after all the to_do's are finished.

    22. All pull requests MUST have at least one comment before being merged.

    23. Contributors MUST NOT list any of the ( fix ) or ( feat ) changes in the special comments of a pull request ( i.e: to_do, description ),

    25. All pull reqeusts MUST contain a well_formatted ( The formatting in this case is optional ) description comment,

        - What results are expected.

    28. The pull_request description comment must start with a header containing the update name
        - ( this is not the same as the pull_request title, it is any name that you would want to assign )
        - followed by the version ( branch ) name.
        - e.x: considering that I am working on a documentation patch, my description header would be: ( UDock | 1.0.0 ).

    29. All Pull requests MUST contain a ```signed off by``` section in their first comment, Continued by tagging all the contributers who participate in the update.

    30. pull_requests MUST be a group of ( fix ) tags which generate one MAJOR CHANGE or feat.

    31. If a update has been rejected or/and left undone, The branch related to the update MUST NOT be deleted, ONLY the pull_request
         - MUST be closed and labled as ```Rejected```

    32. The ```signed off by``` section MUST be at the last section of the comment and refer to the contributors who parted in the update.
