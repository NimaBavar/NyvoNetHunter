NyvoStudio algorithm writing style guide:

    1. Class attributes are visualized using the Attribute shape.:

    2. Loop starting , finishing , changes in operations will be written In sqaure.

    3. Normal logical activites will be written in Milestone plan item ( Not classes , functions , decorators ).

    4. User inputs are shown in Hexagon shape.

    5. System decisions and exceptions will be written In Rhombus.

    6. Functions will be written in Triangles.

    7. Function calls be written In call activity shape ( Yellow Square ).

    8. Connected attributes will be written In Page-refrences shape.

    9. Class and abstract connections will be visualized in the class shape.

    10. Databases are visualized using the Database shape.

    11. Connections will be refrenced with bullethead Lines.

    12. Imports, accesses and inherits will be Refrenced With Arrowhead Lines.

    13. Partitions will be shown in vertical Lines.

    14. Partition names will be shown with the Case File item.

    15. Comments will be shown In Comment_Alt shape.

    16. Numerical orderings will be written in brackets.

    17. Implement indications are designed in ( Implementation event ).

    18. All algorithm files ( Excluding the text-based ones ) must contain an Diagram Info object explaining the purpose of -
        the file.

    19. The diagram info must contain an ( end ) object, describing the outcome or the exportation of the algorithm.

    20. All textual subjects must be written using the Jetbrains Sans Mono font family.

    21. All algorithms must be visualized in Visual Paradigm.
